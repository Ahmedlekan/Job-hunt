            Since launching Job Hunt in 2014, our founders Lee Ballen and Steve
            Perkins have aimed to instil the business with three core characteristics:
            passion, integrity, and quality.

          <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
            From day one, they made it their goal to ensure every client knew how much
            they cared and how they would go above and beyond to deliver a quality
            service.
